# Kitchen OOP üç¥

This repository contains a Java project developed while following an online course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project simulates a virtual kitchen with various functionalities, designed to help you understand and implement key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Features

- **Kitchen Simulation**: Create and manage a virtual kitchen with various appliances, utensils, and ingredients.
- **Appliance Management**: Simulate the use of kitchen appliances like refrigorators, dishWashers, and a coffeeMaker.
- **OOP Principles**: Demonstrates the use of OOP principles in a practical, real-world scenario.

## Key Concepts

- **Classes and Objects**: Understand how to create classes and instantiate objects to represent real-world entities in a kitchen.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Learn how to extend classes and override methods to create flexible and reusable code.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate data within classes and provide controlled access through methods.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract complex kitchen functionalities into simple, understandable class interfaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed on your machine.
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode) or a text editor with Java support.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuliTheProgrammer/SmartKitchen.git
   cd SmartKitchen
   ```

2. **Open in your IDE**:
   Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

3. **Build and Run**:
   Compile the project and run the main class to start the kitchen simulation.

## Usage

Explore the kitchen functionalities by running the main class. You can interact with the kitchen, manage appliances, and simulate cooking processes through the console outputs.

## Learning Outcomes

By following this project, you will gain practical experience in:

- Implementing OOP concepts in Java.
- Structuring code using classes and objects to model real-world scenarios.
- Enhancing code flexibility and maintainability using inheritance and polymorphism.
- Applying encapsulation and abstraction to simplify complex functionalities.
